### Install Git Pre-commit hooks

Install pre-commit by executing the following command in Linux and Mac:

```
pip install pre-commit
```

Initialize pre-commit inside the repo by executing the following command:

```
pre-commit install
```

This will enable the pre-commit to run automatically on git commit!
Please refer this [link](https://pre-commit.com/) for a detailed introduction.
